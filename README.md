# Library Management System
## Overview
This is a simple Library Management System built using Flask, SQLAlchemy (ORM), and basic HTML. It allows users to manage books, customers, and transactions in a library. The project demonstrates CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and the use of Flask as the web framework for handling requests, with SQLAlchemy managing the database.

## Features
### Book Management: Add, update, and remove books in the library.
### Customer Management: Add, update, and remove customers.
### Transaction Management: Track book loans and returns.
### User-friendly Interface: The system uses basic HTML forms and Flask routes to interact with users.
## Technologies Used
### Flask: A lightweight Python web framework for building web applications.
### SQLAlchemy: A Python ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for database interaction.
### HTML/CSS: For frontend interface.
### SQLite: A simple file-based database for storing data (could be replaced with any relational database).
